In this section, you will find examples of how to use the bulkDGD package for different tasks.

If you want an overview of the command-line utilities available in bulkDGD, see the :doc:`Command-line interface <command_line_interface>` section.

Here, we will showcase the usage of the package's functions in the context of larger analysis scripts.

Specifically, we provide detailed tutorials to:

* Find the best representations in latent space for a new set of samples (:doc:`Tutorial 1 <tutorial_1>`).

* Perform differential expression analysis between a set of "treated" samples (for instance, cancer samples) and their corresponding "untreated" samples ("normal" samples) found using the DGD model (:doc:`Tutorial 2 <tutorial_2>`).

* Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of representations and plot the results (:doc:`Tutorial 3 <tutorial_3>`).

The data and Python scripts needed to reproduce the tutorials can be found in the different ``tutorial_*`` directories inside the ``bulkDGD/tutorials/data`` directory.
