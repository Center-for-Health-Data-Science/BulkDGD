bulkDGD is a Python package requiring **Python 3.11 or higher** and several open-source Python packages.

Please ensure that you have Python installed before proceeding with the installation.

The required Python packages will be installed automatically during the installation process. You can inspect the list of packages by opening either the ``requirements.txt`` or the ``environment.yaml`` file.

The bulkDGD package has been tested only on Unix-based systems.

We will show the installation using Python 3.11, but the same steps remain valid for later versions.

Here, we provide instructions for installing bulkDGD in:

*  A simple :doc:`Python virtual environment <installation_venv>`.
*  An :doc:`Anaconda ("conda") environment <installation_conda>` .
